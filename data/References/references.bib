abstract = {Drunk driving, or officially Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of alcohol, is a major cause of traffic accidents throughout the world. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient system aimed at early detection and alert of dangerous vehicle maneuvers typically related to drunk driving. The entire solution requires only a mobile phone placed in vehicle and with accelerometer and orientation sensor. A program installed on the mobile phone computes accelerations based on sensor readings, and compares them with typical drunk driving patterns extracted from real driving tests. Once any evidence of drunk driving is present, the mobile phone will automatically alert the driver or call the police for help well before accident actually happens. We implement the detection system on Android G1 phone and have it tested with different kinds of driving behaviors. The results show that the system achieves high accuracy and energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis and other mycobacteriosis are serious illnesses which control is based on early diagnosis. A technique commonly used consists of analyzing sputum images for detecting bacilli. However, the analysis of sputum is time consuming and requires highly trained personnel to avoid high errors. Image-processing techniques provide a good tool for improving the manual screening of samples. In this paper, a new autofocus algorithm and a new bacilli detection technique is presented with the aim to attain a high specificity rate and reduce the time consumed to analyze such sputum samples. This technique is based on the combined use of some invariant shape features together with a simple thresholding operation on the chromatic channels. Some feature descriptors have been extracted from bacilli shape using an edited dataset of samples. A k-means clustering technique was applied for classification purposes and the sensitivity vs specificity results were evaluated using a standard ROC analysis procedure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Driving style can characteristically be divided into two categories: {\&}{\#}x201C;typical{\&}{\#}x201D; (non-aggressive) and aggressive. Understanding and recognizing driving events that fall into these categories can aid in vehicle safety systems. Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the latest generation of smart cell phones now incorporates many diverse and powerful sensors. These sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e., microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying the physical activity a user is performing. To implement our system we collected labeled accelerometer data from twenty-nine users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing, and then aggregated this time series data into examples that summarize the user activity over 10- second intervals. We then used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. This work is significant because the activity recognition model permits us to gain useful knowledge about the habits of millions of users passively--just by having them carry cell phones in their pockets. Our work has a wide range of applications, including automatic customization of the mobile device's behavior based upon a user's activity (e.g., sending calls directly to voicemail if a user is jogging) and generating a daily/weekly activity profile to determine if a user (perhaps an obese child) is performing a healthy amount of exercise.},

abstract = {Smartwatches and wearables are unique in that they reside on the body, presenting great potential for always-available input and interaction. Their position on the wrist makes them ideal for capturing bio-acoustic signals. We developed a custom smartwatch kernel that boosts the sampling rate of a smartwatch's existing accelerometer to 4 kHz. Using this new source of high-fidelity data, we uncovered a wide range of applications. For example, we can use bio-acoustic data to classify hand gestures such as flicks, claps, scratch- es, and taps, which combine with on-device motion tracking to create a wide range of expressive input modalities. Bio- acoustic sensing can also detect the vibrations of grasped mechanical or motor-powered objects, enabling passive object recognition that can augment everyday experiences with context-aware functionality. Finally, we can generate structured vibrations using a transducer, and show that data can be transmitted through the human body. Overall, our contributions unlock user interface techniques that previ- ously relied on special-purpose and/or cumbersome instru- mentation, making such interactions considerably more feasible for inclusion in future consumer devices.},

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two- level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.},

abstract = {Freezing of gait (FoG) is a common gait deficit in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). FoG events are associated with falls, interfere with daily life activities and impair quality of life. FoG is often resistant to pharmacologic treatment; therefore effective non-pharmacologic assistance is needed. We propose a wearable assistant, composed of a smartphone and wearable accelerometers, for online detection of FoG. The system is based on machine learning techniques for automatic detection of FoG episodes. When FoG is detected, the assistant provides rhythmic auditory cueing or vibrotactile feedback that stimulates the patient to resume walking. We tested our solution on more than 8h of recorded lab data from PD patients that experience FoG in daily life. We characterize the system performance on user-dependent and user-independent experiments, with respect to different machine learning algorithms, sensor placement and preprocessing window size. The final system was able to detect FoG events with an average sensitivity and specificity of more than 95{\%}, and mean detection latency of 0.34s in user-dependent settings.},

@article{Muhammad2014,
abstract = {Human activity recognition is an emerging field of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. Although recent smartphones have powerful resources, the execution of machine learning algorithms on a large amount of data is still a burden on smartphones. Three major factors including; classification algorithm, data feature, and smartphone position influence the recognition accuracy and time. In this paper, we present a comparative study of six classification algorithms, six data features, and four different positions that are most commonly used in the recognition process using smartphone accelerometer. This analysis can be used to select any specific classification algorithm, data feature, and smartphone position for human activity recognition in terms of accuracy and response time. The methodology we used is composed of two major components; a data collector, and a classifier. A set of eleven activities of daily living, four different positions for data collection and ten volunteers contributed to make it a worth-full comparative study. Results show that K-Nearest Neighbor and J48 algorithms performed well both in terms of time and accuracy irrespective of data features whereas the performance of other algorithms is dependent on the selected data features. Similarly, mean and mode features gave good results in terms of accuracy irrespective of the classification algorithm. A short version of the paper has already been presented at ICIS 2014.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.As there is a need for innovative and new medical technologies in the healthcare, we identified Thalmic's MYO Armband, which is used for gaming systems and controlling applications in mobiles and computers. We can exploit this development in the field of medicine and healthcare to improve public health care system. So, we spotted MYO diagnostics, a computer-based application developed by Thalmic labs to understand Electromyography (EMG) lines (graphs), bits of vector data, and electrical signals of our complicated biology inside our arm. The human gestures will allow to gather huge amount of data and series of EMG lines which can be analysed to detect medical abnormalities and hand movements. This application has powerful algorithms which are translated into commands to recognise human hand gestures. The effect of doctors experience on user satisfaction metrics in using MYO armband can be measured in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction which are based on the metrics-Task completion, error counts, task times and satisfaction scores. In this paper, we considered only satisfaction metrics using a widely used System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire model to study the usability on the twenty-four medical students of the Brighton and Sussex Medical School. This helps in providing guidelines about the use of MYO armband for physiotherapy analysis by the doctors and patients. Another questionnaire with a focus on ergonomic (human factors) issues related to the use of the device such as social acceptability, ease of use and ease of learning, comfort and stress, attempted to discover characteristics of hand gestures using MYO. The results of this study can be used in a way to support the development of interactive physiotherapy analysis by individuals using MYO and hand gesture applications at their home for self-examination. Also, the relationship and correlation between the signals received will lead to a better understanding of the whole myocardium system and assist doctors in early diagnosis.},

The sensor module is worn at the left side of waistband, and the embedded algorithm installed in a microcontroller of the sensor module manipulates the sensing data in order to reduce the transferring overhead which causes enormous battery loss. After that, the sensor module transfers them to the subject's PDA phone by means of the Zigbee. Then, the phone accumulates the data for a while and starts to classify them as an ADL (activities of daily living) like running, walking, standing, sitting, lying, falling, etc. As a classifier of ADL, the Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm is used, and we have achieved 95.5{\%} of accuracy in inferring an activity out of 9 ADLs. It shows we can save the battery loss while maintaining the recognition accuracy similarly compared to related works.},
